## This is my first attempt to create font

I have a daughter that is 5 years old, and is awesome :) and she's just starting to learn the alphabet letters and I thought why not make nice little font out of her first (or second) letters that she injoys very much. 

This is my first attempt with working with Inkscape fonts, and I'm just learning the process on my own.

Hope that I would be much better and faster in the future with this process, because this one took some time to create otf out of it :)

After that I created webfont so you can try to play with the letters in the inclosed iframe
