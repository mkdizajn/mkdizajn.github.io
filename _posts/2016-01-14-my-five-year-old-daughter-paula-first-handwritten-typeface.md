## This is my attempt to create font

hi people I got a daughter that is 5 year old and she's just starting to learn the alphabet letters and I thought why not make nice little front out of it. 

This is my first attempt with working with fonts, and I'm just learning the process on my own.

Hope that I would be more better and faster in the future for sure :)
