## My first test how to make a stillmovie worked

Today I was kicked off by my daughter to start and test how to make a simple little stillmotion movie. this is not the movie in that sense of the word, but only a test to see if that could be pulled off. 

So I picked the nose wipes box and put the cellphone on it, and started moving and clicking with the little frog that was drawn couple a days ago,,

The end result was a bunch of pictures, and processed in Gimp to make the gif out of it (with 100ms frame distance).

Here you go :)
