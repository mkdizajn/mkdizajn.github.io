## Should I stay or should I switch? whitch is whitch you askx :)

It's been awhile since Gmail launched Inbox, and I haven't really gotten time to test, from performance stand point, so today I woke up with simple idea how can I know quickly, for my environment, what would perform better (Gmail or Inbox). 

I will totally ignore the cuteness of material design in Inbox and UX of each product and only test general performance of both.

(I'm on this box: Linux hp17-krex 3.13.0-77-generic #121-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jan 20 10:50:42 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux)

The idea is simple. I will try to open one page (only startpage) of each site, and see, by my naked eye, what is faster, eats less RAM and CPU and I will decide on that premise should I switch to Inbox or be on old and very familiar Gmail interface?

I did recording of the above process by monitoring the chrome's built in Task manager, this is the result, see for your self :)

No problem, Gmail it is, for now, your turn Google :)
